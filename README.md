# Slide 1: Title
**Understanding Color Temperature (CCT) & Color Rendering Index (CRI)**

---

# Slide 2: What is CCT?
- **CCT** = Correlated Color Temperature
- Measured in **Kelvin (K)**
- Describes the appearance of white light:
  - 2700K = Warm (yellowish)
  - 4000K = Neutral white
  - 6500K = Cool (bluish white)

# Slide 3: Kelvin Scale Illustration
- Shows range from candlelight to daylight

---

# Slide 4: CCT in Real Spaces
- **Warm (2700K)**: Home, cafes  
- **Neutral (4000K)**: Offices, shops  
- **Cool (6500K)**: Hospitals, labs

# Slide 5: What is CRI?
- **CRI** = Color Rendering Index
- Scale: 0 to 100
- Measures light's ability to reveal accurate colors
- High CRI (>90): True, vibrant colors

---

# Slide 6: CRI Example
- Compare fruits under CRI 70 vs CRI 95

---

# Slide 7: Real-World Applications
- Museums, retail stores need high CRI
- Warehouses, factories may accept lower CRI

---

# Slide 8: CCT vs CRI Comparison Table
| Feature | CCT | CRI |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Definition | Color tone of white light | Accuracy of color rendering |
| Unit | Kelvin (K) | Index (0‚Äì100) |
| Affects | Mood, appearance | Visual clarity, color fidelity |

---

# Slide 9: Choosing the Right CCT
- Warm white (2700K‚Äì3000K): Relaxation
- Neutral white (3500K‚Äì4100K): Focus
- Cool white (5000K‚Äì6500K): Alertness

---

# Slide 10: Choosing the Right CRI
- CRI > 90: Ideal for photography, fashion
- CRI 80‚Äì90: Good for general use
- CRI < 80: Risk of color distortion

---

# Slide 11: Practical Scenarios
- **Office:** 4000K, CRI > 80
- **Studio:** 5000K+, CRI > 95
- **Retail:** 3000‚Äì4000K, CRI > 90

# Slide 12: Reading CCT & CRI in Datasheets
- CCT listed in Kelvin
- CRI may appear as Ra or CRI80/CRI90
- Check both values before selection

# Slide 13: CT vs CCT
- **CT (Color Temperature):** Raw theoretical value
- **CCT:** Human-perceived equivalent color of white light source
- Used more in practical lighting specs

---

# Slide 14: What Affects CCT & CRI Output?
- **1. LED Type & Phosphor Mix**
  - Determines base spectrum
- **2. Driver Current**
  - High currents may shift color output
- **3. Optics & Lenses**
  - Can slightly affect perception
- **4. Heat & Aging**
  - Long-term drift in both CCT and CRI
- **5. Dimming Technology**
  - Some systems shift to warmer tones when dimmed
- **6. CRI Target in Design**
  - Engineered for 80, 90, or 95+ based on phosphor

---

# Slide 15: How to Adjust CCT and CRI
### To change CCT:
- **Change LED Type:** Choose a different Kelvin-rated LED (e.g., 2700K vs 6500K)
- **Phosphor Composition:** More yellow phosphor = warmer CCT
- **Dimming Circuit:** Tunable white drivers can shift CCT when dimmed
- **Optics/Filters:** Can influence perception but not actual CCT

### To change CRI:
- **Use Higher Quality LEDs:** Better spectral coverage (especially red R9)
- **Phosphor Quality:** Specialized phosphors enhance color fidelity
- **Cannot be adjusted electronically or optically** ‚Äî must change the LED
