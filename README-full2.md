# Understanding Color Temperature (CCT) & Color Rendering Index (CRI)

---

# What is CCT?

- **CCT** = Correlated Color Temperature  
- Measured in **Kelvin (K)**  
- Describes the appearance of white light:
  - 2700K = Warm (yellowish)
  - 4000K = Neutral white
  - 6500K = Cool (bluish white)

# CCT in Real Spaces

- **Warm (2700K)**: Home, cafes  
- **Neutral (4000K)**: Offices, shops  
- **Cool (6500K)**: Hospitals, labs

# What is CRI?

- **CRI** = Color Rendering Index  
- Scale: 0 to 100  
- Measures light's ability to reveal accurate colors  
- High CRI (>90): True, vibrant colors

---

# CRI Example

- Compare fruits under CRI 70 vs CRI 95

# Real-World Applications

- Museums, retail stores need high CRI  
- Warehouses, factories may accept lower CRI

# CCT vs CRI Comparison Table

| Feature    | CCT                       | CRI                            |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Definition | Color tone of white light | Accuracy of color rendering    |
| Unit       | Kelvin (K)                | Index (0‚Äì100)                  |
| Affects    | Mood, appearance          | Visual clarity, color fidelity |

# Choosing the Right CCT

- Warm white (2700K‚Äì3000K): Relaxation  
- Neutral white (3500K‚Äì4100K): Focus  
- Cool white (5000K‚Äì6500K): Alertness

---

# Choosing the Right CRI

- CRI > 90: Ideal for photography, fashion  
- CRI 80‚Äì90: Good for general use  
- CRI < 80: Risk of color distortion

---

# Practical Scenarios

- **Office:** 4000K, CRI > 80  
- **Studio:** 5000K+, CRI > 95  
- **Retail:** 3000‚Äì4000K, CRI > 90

---

# Reading CCT & CRI in Datasheets

- CCT listed in Kelvin  
- CRI may appear as Ra or CRI80/CRI90  
- Check both values before selection

# CT vs CCT ‚Äì The Real Difference

| Term        | CT ‚Äì Color Temperature                                 | CCT ‚Äì Correlated Color Temperature                     |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Meaning     | Theoretical color temperature of blackbody radiation  | Perceived color temperature of real-world light sources |
| Source      | Ideal blackbody radiator (physics-based)              | LEDs, fluorescents, etc.                               |
| Used In     | Physics calculations, simulations                     | Lighting design and product specifications             |
| Unit        | Kelvin (K)                                             | Kelvin (K)                                             |

# What Affects CCT & CRI Output?

1. **LED Type & Phosphor Mix** ‚Äì Determines base spectrum  
2. **Driver Current** ‚Äì High currents may shift color output  
3. **Optics & Lenses** ‚Äì Can slightly affect perception  
4. **Heat & Aging** ‚Äì Long-term drift in both CCT and CRI  
5. **Dimming Technology** ‚Äì Some systems shift to warmer tones when dimmed  
6. **CRI Target in Design** ‚Äì Engineered for 80, 90, or 95+ based on phosphor

# How to Adjust CCT and CRI

### To change CCT:

- **Change LED Type:** Choose a different Kelvin-rated LED  
- **Phosphor Composition:** More yellow phosphor = warmer CCT  
- **Dimming Circuit:** Tunable white drivers can shift CCT when dimmed  
- **Optics/Filters:** Influences perception, not true CCT

### To change CRI:

- **Use Higher Quality LEDs:** Better spectral coverage (especially red R9)  
- **Phosphor Quality:** Specialized phosphors enhance color fidelity  
- ‚ùó Cannot be adjusted electronically or optically ‚Äî must change the LED

# Summary

- CCT: Controls mood, ambiance  
- CRI: Ensures accurate color reproduction  
- Choosing the right light = Balanced CCT + CRI
