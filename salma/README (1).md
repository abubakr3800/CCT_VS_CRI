## üìä Summary Table by Age Group

| Age Group               | Activities                                    | Lighting Needs                                                                 | Key Effects |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Early Childhood (3‚Äì6)** | Play, art, storytelling, naps                | - Warm white LED (2700‚Äì3000K)  
- High CRI > 90  
- Soft indirect light 
- Dimmable zones | Reduced anxiety, supports circadian rhythm |
| **Primary School (6‚Äì12)** | Reading, math, science, crafts, group learning | - Cool white LED (3500‚Äì4000K)  
- 500‚Äì700 Lux 
- Low glare (UGR < 19) 
- Daylight integration | Improves comprehension, reduces eye strain |
| **Middle/High School (13‚Äì18)** | Exams, labs, computer use, presentations | - 4000‚Äì5000K neutral to cool white  
- Flicker-free  
- Variable lighting scenes | Boosts cognition, supports digital eye health |

## üß† Biological & Cognitive Considerations

### Circadian Lighting
- **Morning (8‚Äì11 AM)**: 4500‚Äì5000K ‚Äì enhances alertness
- **Afternoon (1‚Äì3 PM)**: 3500‚Äì4000K ‚Äì prevents fatigue
- **Late Classes**: 2700‚Äì3000K ‚Äì dimmed, to reduce overstimulation

## üí° Activity-Based Lighting Guidelines

| Activity            | Ideal LED Features                         | Recommended Lux |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Classroom Learning  | 3500‚Äì5000K, high CRI, low glare             | 500‚Äì700 lx       |
| Art & Design Rooms  | 3000‚Äì4000K, CRI ‚â• 90, directional           | 750‚Äì1000 lx      |
| Libraries           | 3500K, even illumination                    | 300‚Äì500 lx       |
| Science Labs        | 4000‚Äì5000K, strong task lighting            | 750 lx           |
| Sports Halls        | 5000K, wide distribution                    | 300‚Äì500 lx       |
| Corridors           | 3000K, motion sensors                       | 100‚Äì200 lx       |
| Restrooms           | 3000‚Äì3500K, IP-rated fixtures               | 200‚Äì300 lx       |
| Outdoor Playgrounds | 4000‚Äì5000K, durable LED floodlights         | 50‚Äì200 lx        |

## üî¨ Biological Mechanisms & Evidence

- **Circadian Rhythm**: Blue-rich morning light suppresses melatonin for alertness.
- **Cognitive Function**: Tunable LEDs increased reading speed by **35%** and reduced errors by **45%**.
- **Hormonal Effects**: Light impacts cortisol and melatonin, affecting memory, mood, and attention.
- **Visual Development**: High CRI (>90) supports young learners‚Äô vision and reduces myopia risk.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Special Considerations

- **Flicker-Free LEDs**: Prevent headaches, hyperactivity, and neurological stress.
- **Glare Management**: Indirect or diffused fixtures reduce distraction.
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Tunable systems (brightness + color temp) improve mood and behavior.
