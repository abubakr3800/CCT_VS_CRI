# Impact of LED Lighting in International Schools

This document summarizes and preserves the full insights from the report titled **"Impact of LED Lighting in the School International"**. It includes detailed information about lighting design, age-specific lighting requirements, biological impacts, and data-driven effects of LED lighting on student health and academic performance.

## 1. Biological and Developmental Considerations by Age

### A. Early Childhood (Age 3–6)
- **Activities**: Play-based learning, art, storytelling, naps
- **Lighting Needs**:
  - Warm white LED (2700K–3000K)
  - High CRI (>90)
  - Soft indirect lighting
  - Dimmable zones for naps
- **Key Effects**:
  - Reduced anxiety and increased emotional stability
  - Supports healthy circadian rhythms and nap routines

### B. Primary School (Age 6–12)
- **Activities**: Reading, math, science, crafts, group learning
- **Lighting Needs**:
  - Cool white LED (3500K–4000K)
  - 500–700 Lux on desks
  - Low glare (UGR < 19)
  - Daylight integration
- **Key Effects**:
  - Improved reading speed and comprehension
  - Increased attention span and academic engagement
  - Reduced eye strain

### C. Middle and High School (Age 13–18)
- **Activities**: Exams, lab work, computer use, presentations
- **Lighting Needs**:
  - Neutral to cool white (4000K–5000K)
  - Variable lighting scenes:
    - Exam mode (bright/cool)
    - Discussion mode (medium/neutral)
    - Break mode (dim/warm)
  - Flicker-free LED drivers
  - Glare control and anti-reflective surfaces
- **Key Effects**:
  - Enhances cognitive performance
  - Improves mood and alertness
  - Supports digital eye health

## 2. Lighting Parameters by Activity

| Activity              | Ideal LED Features                           | Recommended Lux |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Classroom Learning    | 3500–5000K, high CRI, low glare              | 500–700 lux      |
| Art & Design Rooms    | 3000–4000K, CRI ≥ 90, directional lighting   | 750–1000 lux     |
| Libraries             | 3500K, even illumination                     | 300–500 lux      |
| Science Labs          | 4000–5000K, strong task lighting             | 750 lux          |
| Sports Halls          | 5000K, wide distribution, shatterproof       | 300–500 lux      |
| Corridors             | 3000K, motion sensors                        | 100–200 lux      |
| Restrooms             | 3000–3500K, IP-rated fixtures                | 200–300 lux      |
| Outdoor Playgrounds   | 4000–5000K, durable LED floodlights          | 50–200 lux       |

## 3. Circadian Lighting & School Timing

LED lighting can simulate daylight cycles to support biological rhythms:

- **Morning (8–11 AM)**: Bright, cool light (4500–5000K) enhances alertness.
- **Afternoon (1–3 PM)**: Neutral light (3500–4000K) prevents fatigue.
- **Evening classes**: Warm dimmed lighting reduces overstimulation.

---

## 4. Specific Biological Mechanisms

- **Circadian Rhythm**: Cool blue-rich light in the morning suppresses melatonin, enhancing alertness.
- **Cognitive Function**: High CCT and brightness increase reading speed (by 35%) and reduce errors (by 45%).
- **Hormonal Effects**: Correct lighting supports cortisol and melatonin secretion, modulating mood and memory.
- **Visual Development**: High CRI and adequate brightness reduce myopia risk and support vision development.

---

## 5. Special Considerations

- **Flicker-Free LEDs**: Prevent headaches, eyestrain, and hyperactivity, especially important in special education.
- **Glare Management**: Use diffused or indirect fixtures, especially near screens or reflective surfaces.
- **Dynamic/Tunable Lighting**: Adjustable brightness and color temperature boosts engagement and mood.

## 6. Experimental Study (Memory and Attention)

### Setup:
Participants were randomly exposed to different lighting conditions: 300 lx, 400 lx, 500 lx, and 1000 lx.

- **Step 1**: 2-minute adaptation (dark and light)
- **Step 2**: 10-minute learning session (nonsense syllables)
- **Step 3**: Working memory test (symbol recognition)
- **Step 4**: Long-term memory test 24h later (WFC task)

**Results** analyzed via SPSS with LSD post-hoc, significance at p < 0.05.
